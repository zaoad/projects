In our project, we have divided the PCs into two categories. One is a server PC and
the other is client PCs. All the PCs are connected under the same LAN connection. So,
using the IP address of server PC other client PCs can be easily connected.
Firstly, the server PC needs an account. We used MySQL database for sending and
retrieving information to open an account. After opening account, one can easily
login and use our project efficiently.
Secondly, we have added the features to control other PCs. Features are sleep,
shutdown, lock pc, send files, receive files, give a message, delete files, install
software . We did these using the command prompt. Even we used the “Robot” class for
monitoring and controlling other PC.
Actually, in our project, we have given the option to control a single PC or multiple
PCs. Even the user can determine how many PCs he wants to control. This option
helps the user to specify the number of PCs he wants to dictate. To make it more user-friendly one just need to click the button. Then the correct command will go to the client
PCs. According to the button clicking the program of the project will react.
We used the MySQL database for security. Then we used Java GUI, Robot class and
multithreading system to make it more user-friendly.
